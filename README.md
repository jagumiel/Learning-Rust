# Learning-Rust

## _Introduction_

Rust is a modern systems programming language that emphasizes performance, security, and concurrency. It was developed by Mozilla and is designed to be fast, memory safe, and easy to write and maintain.

Rust is a statically typed language that provides many features typically found in high-level languages, such as garbage collection, memory safety, and object-oriented programming. However, Rust is unique in that it provides these features without sacrificing performance, making it an excellent choice for systems programming and other performance-critical applications.

One of the key features of Rust is its ownership and borrowing system, which ensures that memory is managed safely and efficiently without the need for garbage collection. This makes it possible to write low-level system code that is both fast and safe, without the risk of common memory-related bugs such as null pointers, buffer overflows, and use-after-free errors.

Rust also provides excellent support for concurrency, with built-in features such as threads and asynchronous programming. This makes it easy to write concurrent, high-performance applications that take full advantage of today's multi-core CPUs.

## _Exercise statements:_
1. Hello, World!: Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
